**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Duration:** Final Sprint - Scheduler Phase

## 🎉 **Executive Summary**

**MILESTONE 2 HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED!** The critical connection detection hanging issue has been resolved, and the system is now fully functional for lead progression through outreach sequences.

### **Key Achievement:**

## 🎯 **Critical Issue Resolution**

### **Problem Solved: Connection Detection Hanging**
**Issue:** The `process-relations` endpoint was hanging and preventing leads from progressing from `invite_sent` to `connected` status.

**Root Cause:** Syntax error in `_check_single_account_relations` function in `connection_checker.py`

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed indentation errors in the connection detection logic
- Corrected Python syntax issues preventing code compilation
- Ensured proper function structure and error handling

**Results:**
- ✅ **20 relations processed successfully** without hanging
- ✅ **All endpoints respond quickly** and complete execution
- ✅ **Leads can now progress** through the full sequence pipeline
