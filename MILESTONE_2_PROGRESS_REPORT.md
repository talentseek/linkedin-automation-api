## 🚧 **Current Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Lead Status Mismatch**
**Problem:** Leads are stuck in `invite_sent` status but should be `connected` or `completed`

**Root Cause:** Connection detection not properly updating lead statuses when connections are accepted

**Solution:** 
- Fixed field mapping in connection detection (`member_id`, `public_identifier`)
- Need to test connection detection with real data
- Implement automatic status updates for completed leads

### **Issue 2: Connection Detection Hanging**
**Problem:** `process-relations` endpoint hangs and doesn't complete

**Root Cause:** Likely an infinite loop or API timeout in the connection processing logic

**Solution:**
- Fixed syntax error in `_check_single_account_relations`
- Need to add timeout handling and better error recovery
- Consider implementing async processing for large datasets

### **Issue 3: Step Completion Logic**
**Problem:** Leads with `current_step: 4` should be marked as `completed` but aren't

**Root Cause:** Step completion logic exists but isn't being triggered properly

**Solution:**
- Added step completion detection in `_is_lead_ready_for_processing`
- Need to test with real data to ensure it works correctly

## 🔧 **Technical Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Lead Processing Logic**
```python
def _is_lead_ready_for_processing(self, lead):
    # Added comprehensive logging
    # Added step completion detection
    # Added proper status validation
    # Added delay calculation improvements
```

### **2. Fixed Connection Detection**
```python
def _process_relation(relation, account_id):
    # Fixed field mapping: member_id, public_identifier
    # Added proper lead lookup logic
    # Enhanced error handling and logging
```

### **3. Improved Error Handling**
```python
def _process_loop(self):
    # Individual try-catch blocks for each processing step
    # Graceful error recovery
    # Detailed logging for debugging
    # Prevents scheduler crashes
```

### **4. Enhanced Step Execution**
```python
def execute_step(self, lead, step, linkedin_account):
    # Proper action type handling
    # Enhanced validation and logging
    # Improved error recovery
    # Status update logic
```
